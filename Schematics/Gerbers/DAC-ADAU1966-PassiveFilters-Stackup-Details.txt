Expected PCB stack-up for 4 layer boards:

1oz copper
0.2mm FR4 - Prepreg
0.5oz copper
1.2mm FR4 - Core
0.5oz copper
0.2mm FR4 - Prepreg
1oz copper

Note inner core can be any thickness to give desired overall PCB thickness, both prepreg layers must be 0.2mm FR4.


2 layer boards are designed to be 1.6mm overall thickness.
